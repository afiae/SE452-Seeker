# SE452-Seeker

The full CRUD operations for the Student, StudentAcademics, and StudentResume tables  can be accessed via the Register, Edit Profile, and Add to Profile toolbar buttons on localhost:8081. The add operation for the SudentCerts table can be accessed from the Add to Profile button. 

The Read, Update, and Delete operation for StudentCerts is access by typing in localhost:8081/student/{id} where ID refers to the student ID. For this application there are currently only five Students in the db so only 5 IDs which are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
